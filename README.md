# The Butterfly Effect: A Computational Journey Through Chaos 🦋

## Exploring the Mathematical Beauty of Deterministic Chaos

> _"Does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?"_ - Edward Lorenz

This project implements a high-performance C++ simulation of the **Lorenz Attractor**, one of the most iconic examples of deterministic chaos in dynamical systems theory. Through numerical integration techniques and real-time 3D visualization, we explore how simple nonlinear differential equations can produce infinitely complex, yet beautifully structured behavior.

## 🧠 The Mathematics Behind the Magic

### The Lorenz System: Where Order Meets Chaos

The Lorenz attractor emerges from a deceptively simple system of three coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs):

![Lorenz Equations](assets/equations/lorenz.png)

```mathematica
dx/dt = σ(y - x)
dy/dt = x(ρ - z) - y
dz/dt = xy - βz
```

Where the classic parameters are:

-   **σ = 10** (Prandtl number - relates momentum and thermal diffusion)
-   **ρ = 28** (Rayleigh number - measures buoyancy vs viscous forces)
-   **β = 8/3** (geometric aspect ratio)

### The Emergence of Chaos

What makes this system extraordinary is its **sensitive dependence on initial conditions** - the hallmark of chaos. Two trajectories starting arbitrarily close together will exponentially diverge, yet remain bounded within a finite phase space, creating the iconic "butterfly-shaped" strange attractor.

**Lyapunov Exponent**: λ ≈ 0.9056, indicating strong chaotic behavior
**Fractal Dimension**: D ≈ 2.06, revealing the attractor's non-integer dimensionality

## 🔬 Numerical Methods: Precision in the Face of Chaos

This implementation showcases two fundamental numerical integration schemes for solving systems of ODEs:

### Euler's Method

![Euler Method](assets/equations/euler.png)

The simplest first-order method:

```cpp
x_{n+1} = x_n + h·f(x_n, t_n)
```

**Pros**: Computationally efficient, easy to implement
**Cons**: Lower accuracy, potential for numerical instability

### Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)

![RK4 Method](assets/equations/rk4.png)

A fourth-order method providing superior accuracy:

```cpp
k1 = h·f(x_n, t_n)
k2 = h·f(x_n + k1/2, t_n + h/2)
k3 = h·f(x_n + k2/2, t_n + h/2)
k4 = h·f(x_n + k3, t_n + h)
x_{n+1} = x_n + (k1 + 2k2 + 2k3 + k4)/6
```

**Trade-off Analysis**: RK4 requires 4× the function evaluations but provides O(h⁴) vs O(h) accuracy.
